Feedback from Mack on 11/7/2018

One obsession before the launch - New user flow.  Getting new players into the game.

- [ ] make the sign in button more red/obvious than other buttons on home page
- [ ] not obvious when logged in after logging in.
- [ ] no confirmation your name was saved in profile.
- [ ] where do i start once logged in? not obvious.
- [ ] mack would love to see the names of the kitties on the draft a kitty screen. 
- [ ] origin filter not working 
- [ ] roster should indicate 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 so people know they need 3 kitties to start.  should then direct them to create a team
- [ ] button alingment in team page under kitties is off. 
- [ ] once team is made, should present a way to go right into battle
- [ ] green card border is confusing with selected cat indicator.
- [ ] origins weaknesses under turn order
- [ ] a lot of matches are showing in the spectate section that are not valid.
- [ ] the first experience should demonstrate a fully leveled up team with good items to give them an idea of where the game can end up.
